Brief
Learning Objectives
Implement document chunking and embedding


Build vector databases


Create retrieval pipelines


Understand semantic search


Assignment Requirements
Part A: RAG System Setup (50%)


Create resume_rag.py:


Document Processing Pipeline


Load resumes using file system tools from Milestone 1


Chunk documents intelligently (preserve sections like Education, Experience)


Generate embeddings using OpenAI/Cohere/HuggingFace models


Store in vector database (ChromaDB, Pinecone, or Weaviate)


Metadata Extraction


Extract key fields: Name, Skills, Experience Years, Education


Store metadata alongside embeddings for filtering


Part B: Job Matching Engine (50%)


Create job_matcher.py:


Semantic Search


Accept job description as input


Convert JD to embedding


Retrieve top-K similar resumes (K=10)


Implement hybrid search (semantic + keyword for critical skills)


Ranking & Scoring


Score matches (0-100 scale)


Provide match reasoning (which sections matched)


Filter by must-have requirements (e.g., “5+ years Python”)



Output Format
{


  "job_description": "...",


  "top_matches": [


    {


      "candidate_name": "John Doe",


      "resume_path": "resumes/john_doe.pdf",


      "match_score": 92,


      "matched_skills": ["Python", "Machine Learning"],


      "relevant_excerpts": ["..."],


      "reasoning": "Strong match for ML experience..."


    }
